CCA Tutorial
============

This tutorial demonstrates the use of CCA for 2 views and multiview CCA (MCCA)
for more than 2 views. As is demonstrated, they allow for both the addition of
regularization as well as the use of a kernel to compute the distance
(Gram) matrices (KMCCA).

# CCA
# ^^^
#
# CCA, equivalent to 2 view MCCA, learns transformations of the views,
# projecting a linear combination of the features to a component such that the
# sum of correlations between the ith components of each view is maximized. We
# see the top three components of the first two views plotted against each
# other, pairwise. The strong linear shape on the diagonals shows that the
# found components correlate well.

# the default is no regularization meaning this is SUMCORR-AVGVAR MCCA

                scatter_kwargs = {'alpha': 0.4, 's': 2.0})

# In the 2 view setting, a variety of interpretable statistics can be
# calculated. We assess the canonical correlations achieved and
# their significance using the p-values from a Wilk's Lambda test

# Regularized CCA
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We can add regularization with the `regs` argument to handle
# high-dimensional data. This data is simple, and so it makes little
# difference. Here, we use MCCA for all 3 views.

# regularization value of .5 for each view
mcca = MCCA(n_components = joint_rank, regs = 0.5)

# the fit-transform method outputs the scores for each view

###############################################################################
# Informative MCCA: PCA then MCCA
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We can also handle high-dimensional data with i-MCCA. We first compute a
# low rank PCA for each view, then run MCCA on the reduced data. With rank 2
# PCA, only the first two CCA components are informative, as we can see in the
# plot.

# Kernel MCCA
# ^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We can compute kernel MCCA with the KMCCA() object. With the linear kernel,
# this behaves just like MCCA.
